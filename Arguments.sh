# A best practices Bash script template with many useful functions. This file
# sources in the bulk of the functions from the source.sh file which it expects
# to be in the same directory. Only those functions which are likely to need
# modification are present in this file. This is a great combination if you're
# writing several scripts! By pulling in the common functions you'll minimise
# code duplication, as well as ease any potential updates to shared functions.

# A better class of script...
